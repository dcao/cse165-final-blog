Progress for this week has been relatively light; since most of our group members are at capacity focusing on other classes and tasks, we haven't been able to get too too much implementation work done on the project. However, we've been slowly pushing along on both the ideation and implementation fronts, setting up the groundwork to be able to hit the ground running come this next week.

In terms of the ideation side, we've started drafting more detailed notes about our preferred interaction models and figuring out which modes of interaction that we want to have for our project. In particular, we've been thinking about how to do system control and interaction with the UI, and whether we should use virtual screen/tapping gestures or do distal interaction like we did with the AR project (i.e. a pinch to select feature).

On the implementation side, much of the work has been doing knowledge work, researching how we could potentially implement all of our desired features and looking into assets we could potentially use for our project. On the concrete side of things, we've created a basic Unity project that has all of the hand-tracking features set up, so that we can start implementation in earnest.

Looking towards the future, our immediate next steps for implementation are two-fold: building out a cafe environment for the user to explore and settling on a UI interaction mode that the user can use to interact with our system controls.
