We managed to make more substantial progress during this last week! As before, our group members were busy at work taking care of all their work across a number of different classes, but we were still able to get substantial work done. This week's progress was more implementation-heavy, laying the foundation for us to push towards the finish line and complete our final project.

The first main implementation update was that we added support for the Oculus Voice SDK by following the official documentation. We created a test scene and got a working demo of voice recognition support, shown below:

The second main implementation update was that, using external assets, we were able to create the cafe scene in which the virtual encounter will take place, as shown below:

On the ideation side, we've also settled on our UI modalities that we want to incorporate: hand-tracking with pinch-to-select behavior for our main ui tasks, along with a wrist-mounted display as a "main menu."
